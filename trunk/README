The keys3 package is an experimental implementation of key
management for LaTeX3.  The entire package is written in
expl3 code rather than in traditional TeX/LaTeX.  The key
module used by keys3 is based on that introduced by the
pgfkeys package from the pgf/TiKZ bundle. Keys are thus
addressed in a path-like manner, and are controlled by key
properties:

/module/key/.code:n = <code>,
/module/key/.value required:,
/module/key = <value>

The keys3 package is intended as a method for testing how key
management might be implemented in LaTeX3.  Both the methods
used inside the package and the interface provided are intended
to be discussed.  Feedback is welcomed either by e-mail
(joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk) or at the package website
(http://keys3.berlios.de).

The experimental nature of keys3 and the underlying expl3
system means that it should not be used in production
documents.  However, programmers testing expl3, or keen to work
on improved key management systems, are encouraged to try the
package and provide feedback.

keys3 is *not* an official LaTeX3 team package.  Whether any of
the ideas explored here will be taken up by the team is
therefore unknown.  However, the keys3 package should provide
ideas on what needs to be available for key management and how
it can be implemented.
