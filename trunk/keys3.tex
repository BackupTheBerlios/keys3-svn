% This is a demonstration file for keys3, an experimental package for
% key management in LaTeX3.  The file should compile giving two
% \show results and exactly six errors:
% - "The key `/module name/key seven' requires a value and is being
%   ignored."
% - "The key `/module name/key eight' cannot taken a value, which is
%   being ignored."
% - "Key `/module name/key ten' has multiple arguments and was
%   expanded: adding code may give incorrect results."
% - "Key `/module name /key eighteen' takes the Boolean values `true'
%   and `false' only. The given value `rubbish' is ignored."
% - "Choice `what?' unknown for key `/module name/key twenty': the
%   value given is being ignored."
% - "The key `/module name/unknown key' is unknown and is being
%   ignored."
